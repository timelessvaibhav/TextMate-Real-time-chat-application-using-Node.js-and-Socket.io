# TextMate
A real time multi-user chat application made using **Node.js** and **Socket.io** where users can communicate with each other by joining a conversation room and sending and receiving messages in real time. All the users inside the conversation space are notified whenever a new user joins or an existing user leaves room. The project was developed with the intention to understand the concept and application of **real time, bidirectional and event-based communication between browser and the server** and has been built on a completely **responsive web design**
